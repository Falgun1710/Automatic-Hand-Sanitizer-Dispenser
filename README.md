# CS-207 FINAL PROJECT
# Automatic-Hand-Sanitizer-Dispenser

# Introduction.

In this current time of the pandemic, hand sanitizers are playing a key role in helping people keep their hands clean and reduce the spread of the deadly virus as much as possible. Germs are everywhere! Whether it be the Covid-19 virus or any other microorganisms which easily spread through touch, this can be prevented by washing hands at regular intervals or sanitizing hands with the use of an alcohol-based sanitizer. No one likes to touch the hand sanitizer bottles which are touched and used by lakhs of people every day. You cannot find a place to wash your hands with soap and water everywhere and so hand sanitizer plays a key role over here. We can reduce the risk of the spread of this virus by using automatic hand sanitizer dispensers which detect motion and dispense the sanitizer without having to touch the bottle of sanitizer which thousands of people touch every now and then. 
I have seen such automatic hand sanitizer dispensers almost at each and every place where people gather in large numbers. In this project we are going to make an automatic hand sanitizer dispenser inspired by MissionCritical on instructables.com. We are going to make it with the help of Arduino Uno instead of Arduino Nano if possible. We are using an ultrasonic sensor to detect the motion, a servo motor, jumper wires, and most importantly a good alcohol-based sanitizer.

# Requirements:- 
1. Arduino UNO 
2. Breadboard 
3. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor  
4. SG90 servo motor 
5. Adaptor (any other power source) we have used a power bank.
6. Male female wires

# Usage:
Hygiene is very important to all of us these days. So this project made by us is a really helpful thing especially in the time of such pandemic. Such automatic hand sanitizer dispensers are used everywhere. These dispensers are really helpful and are contactless, there is no need to touch the sanitizerâ€™s container, let the sensor detect motion and you are good to go.
